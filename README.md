🤖 2-Link Robotic Arm GUI – Linear Algebra Project
This project is a simple and interactive robotic arm simulation built in MATLAB. It shows how linear algebra is used to control robotic movement.

Key Features:

🦾 Simulates a 2-link planar robotic arm.

🎛️ Sliders control the angles of both joints (θ1 and θ2).

📐 Uses transformation matrices to calculate the position of each link.

🟢 Real-time visual update of the arm and end effector.

📊 Shows live (x, y) coordinates of the end effector.

👨‍💻 Great example of applying linear algebra to robotics and GUI design.
